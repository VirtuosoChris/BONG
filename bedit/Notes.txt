BONG Map Editor

This Version of the editor is certainly usable and is "done" but there are a number
of places it could use improvement. 

Such as . . . 

For one, a minimum amount of effort could be invested in fixing the window resize function
so the user can resize the window without distorting the cursor coordinates.

Additionally, the minimap window causes a significant hit in performance.  This could be fixed.

Spots in the Map Options Menu for music and background files have been left, as well as
music files.  String space will be reserved in the file system too.
These are not usable at present because I have no idea what forms these
two features will take in the game so they don't work in the editor yet.  I don't even know if
the final game will have image backgrounds or not. . . Music of some sort is a certainty however.
Whether the backgrounds will be left blank, use image backgrounds or have procedural, trippy effects
is as of yet unknown

Clicking and dragging, as well as multiple selection would be convenient.  Notices where 2 objects have the same
coordinates would prevent "waste" -- or maybe just prevent multiple placement of objects of the same type


click to location on minimap


additionally there are several messy areas of code that could be cleaned up for my own personal 
satisfaction

Row/column creation tools?

lock keys-- helps draw in straight lines

Intelligent ball placing--no the editor is not idiot proof use warning in helpfile instead
