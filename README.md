# BONG (Breakout-Pong)

My first game and first "real" C program ever.  Written when I was a senior in high school and finished my first semester of college.

I added a CMAKE project to build the game and editor, and it should just work out of the box with no fiddling.

The code is straight up garbage as one might expect from a 17 year old, but I show a surprising sophistication here in terms of understanding video game programming fundamentals.

At this point I would have learned a lot of my fundamentals from reading NeHe / Gamedev tutorials.  The site also had a great section for recommending books, which I made liberal use of back then to get more advanced.

For this project, the OpenGL Red Book 3rd Edition and Charles Petzold's massive tome on Win32 programming were my constant companions.   I would have carried one or both of them on the bus to school early in the morning, shoving them in my already overstuffed backpack.

I don't really have any interest in porting the game to new tech or remaking it but I'm making this repo
1) for posterity
2) I can do some cleanup / refactoring so the code is legible and easy to build

The crappy MSPaint textures I made as well as the sound files are lost media, resulting in a minimalist appearance that is actually better than the original.  Replacing or finding the original  media files is on the agenda/
