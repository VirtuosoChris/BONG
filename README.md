# BONG (Breakout-Pong)

My first game and first C program ever.  Written when I was a senior in high school and finished my first semester of college.

I don't really have any interest in porting the game to new tech or remaking it but I'm making this repo
1) for posterity
2) I can do some cleanup / refactoring so the code is legible and easy to build
